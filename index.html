  <h3> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </h3>
  <p>Progressive enhancement to me is content oriented.  With Graceful degredation they were focused on browser interaction with the content, trying to accomidate outdated browsers.  Progressive enhancement is focused on producing quality content, building it up with a little css, sprinkling in some java; to produce great content.  It is not browser focused since everyone has there own prefrences on what they are looking for.  Build the baseline out is progressive enhancement.  Building the final product and tailoring it in is graceful degradation.</p><a href="https://www.mavenecommerce.com/2017/10/31/progressive-enhancement-vs-graceful-degradation/"> outside article</a>
  
  <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection Assignment</h3>
  <p>I know that my rough draft and revised only difference is the slideshow I included at the bottom.  That being said the originally draft had no CSS other than what I lifted from your code cast.  Thank you for that since it was a solid template to build off of.  I went through having to rewatch videos while I went through connecting the dots on what effects what between the html and css.  I played with the background colors and decided on gradient to resolve visibilty issues with the text.  I showed my revised version to a friend who codes for fun, and I recommend you do not do that or you will be made fun of.  I started adding images from the web because I didnt want to use everything that was yours for creative purposes.  As far as anyone I asked aside from the computer nerd, no one had input because they didnt understand or know what could be added.</p>
  
  <p>I can honestly say that after taking this class, I wont be going out to build websites for clients.  I do however have a much better understanding of what goes into the process.  I can play with different sites and build small webpages as a hobby utilizing what I know from this course.  It has provided very solid building blocks that allowed me to manipulate a webpage into what I wanted it to be.  I am thankful for the skills this has added to my toolbox. If I had to do this all over again, I would've added more java script to make the articles hide under the picture and slide down when clicked, as well as the FAQ page.</p>
